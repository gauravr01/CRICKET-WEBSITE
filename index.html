        <p class="p1"><b>Nets are fundamental to cricket practice and are used at every level of the game. 
            Professional cricket clubs are likely to have over 10 lanes of nets, and be able to practice both indoors and outdoors.
             Nets are also very prevalent in educational establishments, as they allow
              safe and efficient training with a high volume of pupils when there are significant time constraints.
             Keen cricketers may have nets in their gardens.
            Nets helps safe practice. By containing most aerial cricket balls, they reduce the potential for injury
             of bystanders. However, the nets
             need an opening for the bowler, so it is still common for balls to leave the nets, and shouts of heads up are commonly heard.

<p class="p1"> <b> Netting is the most important component. The netting twine is usually made of a synthetic polymer such as polyethylene,
     which is hardwearing and relatively cheap. Before about 1995, nets were often made from nylon, but this became too expensive.
      Nets are often black, green or white. The mesh gap is usually 50 mm and the twine will commonly have a diameter of 1.8 to 3.0 mm. 
      Netting may be knotless or knotted: knotted is considered superior. The breaking strength of knotted netting is higher for the
       same diameter twine. Good twine will be UV stabilized and rot proof. For home-made nets, netting is the only specialist supply.

    Netting is seamed at its edges to prevent fraying. The seam is usually a 6 mm cord sewn into the netting where it meets a 
    cage or end. Canvas blinkers can be added to offer privacy and to reduce wear. Also, partial canvas skirts of 0.5 m can be 
    added to the bottom to prevent damage from wild animals.</p>

<div class="boxm" style="margin-top: 60px;">
    <p class="p1"><b>Batsmen are allowed to wear gloves while batting. The batsman can be also caught out if the ball touches the glove instead of the bat, provided the hand is in contact with the bat. This is because the glove is considered to be the extension of the bat. The batsman may also wear protective helmets, usually with a visor, to protect themselves. Helmets are usually employed when facing fast bowlers. While playing spinners, it might not be employed (though injuries are still possible[1]).

        Fielders cannot use gloves to field the ball. If they wilfully use any part of their clothing to field the ball they may be penalised 5 penalty runs to the opposition. If the fielders are fielding close to the batsman, they are allowed to use helmets and leg guards worn under their clothing.[2]
        
        As the wicket-keeper is positioned directly behind the batsman, and therefore has the ball bowled directly at him, he is the only fielder allowed to wear gloves and (external) leg guards.[3]
        
        Cricket clothing is generally white In Test cricket, as is traditional, but limited-overs cricket players generally have clothing based on team colors, similar to other sports.
